# An Email/SMS spam detection

A system that predicts the provided text or message is a spam or ham. This is the project which I did for my final semester project.

By automating the gathering, processing, and presentation of spam data, this project seeks to close that gap and provide authorities and users with useful information. It increases cybersecurity awareness and aids victims of cybercrime by facilitating quicker threat identification and response. By enabling spam reports through an easy-to-use web interface, our technology streamlines user engagement.

Problem statement: A major cybersecurity danger is the increase in spam, phishing tactics, and fraudulent digital communications. Complex and dynamic threats are frequently missed by conventional spam filters. The use of user-reported data is essential for spotting emerging spam tendencies. The goal of this project is to create a reliable spam detection system that uses machine learning for analysis and categorization. It will also incorporate insights and data visualization for trend analysis and real-time monitoring.
